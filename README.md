# Simple-Tkinter-Music-Player

In that project, I used tkinter on python to create a simple music player. I'm just a curious person, and I think the code is too bad.
But this was funny.
Cool Features (simple but cool):
- Randomly order
- Playlist creation
- Auto download of musics from Youtube in background. Using Selenium. 

Just 4 fun.

Example using:

Possibly upgrades:
- Menu to delete musics
- Organize functions in others files
- Remove the console when the program is open
- Edit isn't working
