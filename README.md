# Simple-Tkinter-Music-Player V2

While I was using the older version, I had some problems, like very slow in .exe, music bugging, etc.

### Objectives
- Easy to use
- Fast (just a few libs)
- Playlists (like the older, but prettier)
- Filter to songs (when new song is added you have the possibility to add some caracteristics, like type, singer, etc. To use that info in a filter)

### Observations and Possible Upgrades
- There will be two apps, one will be the full version, and the other will be the lite version
- Function to create buttons more easily

### Lite version
This version will be for faster application, will not have downloads, and some others features

Just 4 fun.

- Advance and before musics
- Randomize method (perfect working, and tested)
- Keyboard Functions
- Menu Frame (all, recent, playlists)
- Changed the music module, (tkinter -> VLC) Because of the size of tkinter, is much bigger than VLC module, and VLC don't bugs in my pc, like Tkinter.
- Playlists settings (delete and create)

Created the function to play/unpause, pause and check if the music is playing.

I selected Pygame.mixer, because of the big community and the great mixer controls.
