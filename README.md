# Simple-Tkinter-Music-Player

In that project, I used tkinter on python to create a simple music player. I'm just a curious person, and I think the code is too bad.
But this was funny.
Cool Features (simple but cool):
- Randomly order
- Playlist creation
- Auto download of musics from Youtube in background. Using Selenium. 

Just 4 fun.

Example using:

Possibly upgrades:
- Remove unecessary files on the repository
- When play after pause, continue in the time that was paused
- Menu to delete musics
- Prettier config menu
- Remove Loops that are making the sound bad, or other solution (Maybe try in another PC, because in mine other app has this little breakes that are making the sound bad)
