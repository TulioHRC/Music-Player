# Simple-Tkinter-Music-Player V2

While I was using the older version, I had some problems, like very slow in .exe, music bugging, etc.

### Objectives
- Easy to use
- Fast (just a few libs)
- Playlists (like the older, but prettier)
- Filter to songs (when new song is added you have the possibility to add some caracteristics, like type, singer, etc. To use that info in a filter)

### Observations and Possible Upgrades
- There will be two apps, one will be the full version, and the other will be the lite version
- Function to create buttons more easily

### Lite version
This version will be for faster application, will not have downloads, and some others features


Just 4 fun.

Example on Older version using:

## LOG
Remembering that the versions above 1.0.0 will restart all the project

### 1.2 (Menu to use)
I created:
- The player frame (audio functions), menu frame (playlists) and stuff frame (music list)
- Advance and before musics
- Randomize method (perfect working, and tested)


### 1.1.1 (Audio Functions, create all the audio functions that I will use, and test it)
Created the function to play/unpause, pause and check if the music is playing.

### 1.1.0 (Finding the better way to play musics)
I selected Pygame.mixer, because of the big community and the great mixer controls.

### 1.0.0 (Older Version)
